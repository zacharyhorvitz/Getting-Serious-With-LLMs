### Hindi Data Generation

- [**`filter.py`**](./filter.py)  
  Script for secondarily filtering unfunned examples still classified as humorous (by GPT-4) 

- [**`generate_hindi_unfuns.py`**](./generate_hindi_unfuns.py)
  Few shot English-Hindi unfun generation script.

### TODO:

- [ ] Cean-up/refactoring here + move some of this logic to the parent directory. As an artifact of how work was split by collaborators, English-Hindi unfun logic is currently here in its own subdirectory.
